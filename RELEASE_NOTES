This is release 3.9 of the SAL SDK (April 13th, 2018)

Changes for 3.8

Add SAL__STATE_ defines for generic states
Add support for Python OO library
Move CSC dictionary to ts_xml/sal_interfaces/SALSubsystems.xml and change to XML format
Remove generic Commands/Events from generated MagicDraw XMI importable
Change location of Nexus repository

Changes for 3.7.2

Update CSC list
Remove rougue setup file

Changes for 3.7.1

****************IMPORTANT***************************************************************
The salgenerator will no longer auto-generate generic commands or events, they must now 
be defined in the UML model and flow down to the XML from there.
****************************************************************************************

Please refer to the SAL User Guide for installation instructions.

Fixed java commanders to include an origin field (temporarily a default)

Fixed SQL table generator string handling

Improved runtime generator scripts

Reduced unit test time

Fixed LabVIEW command/response issues

Added missing pybind11 wrappers

Added generic UML generator with Magic Draw support

Moved checkStatus into SAL classes

Added tuneableQos support to java api

Cleaned up c++ with/without python library build

Changed generated Makefiles to use SAL_WORK_DIR for libraries

Speed up maven CI by ommitting no-value tests


Changes for 3.7.0.

Added support for Enumerations, either per item , or globally
(code support in C++,Java,Python,LabVIEW)

Bug fixes for Java code generation.

Add support for pybind11 based python wrappers. Boost::Python support
is now deprecated and will be removed in version 4.0.0

Add support for LargeFileObject announcment events

Update SAL User Guide

Add support for automatic creation of EFD writer processes.

Add script to automate updating of https://project.lsst.org/ts/sal_objects website

Fix LabVIEW Event handling

Add new CSC's for headerService's, ecc, summitFacility, atcs, vms

Add monitorCommand method for LabVIEW API

Upgrade Event Junit tests

Bug fixes for LabVIEW Monitor process

Add minimal Telemetry generation to  XML parser

Default to adding generic Commands and Events in XML parser if not preset in 
incoming XML files (temporary exception for m1m3 to use non-compliant generic command set)



Release 3.6 deprecated - do not use


Changes for 3.5.2

New CSC's for Auxillary Telesope (accs) and instrumentation
Default to Python3 compatability
Enumeration support in XML and downstream


Changes for 3.5.1

Provide compatability with the LSST OpenSpliceDDS 6.7 release
(salgenerator now avoids hardcoding the OpenSplice release number into the maven project generator)

Changes for 3.5.0

The LabVIEW interface is now based on passing Cluster datatypes which should make
it easier to use. The VI generation process is a little more involved, so please refer to 
the updated user guide (chapter 9) for more information.
    
The LabVIEW shared memory Monitor has been upgraded to support multiple (50) simulataneous
LabVIEW connections per machine and subsystem (due to this change, calling shmRelease prior
to application exit is now mandatory).
  
Removed sample XML object definition files to avoid confusion of versions. The definitive XML
should always be retreived from the LSST Stash ts_xml repository.
     
The Python interface has been modified to incorporate control of the Global Interpreter Lock
(GIL) to allow the DDS threads sufficient cpu time under high load conditions.

Added new commandable subsystems for DM (archiver, catchuparchiver, and processingcluster)
and OCS (sequencer).

Added salgenerator error detection for "no language" selected when using sal code generation.

Added hooks for per-topic QoS tuning control in future.

Added bandwidth documentation updater

Enhanced SAL object table html format table output

Added LABVIEW_HOME environment variable to permit user control

Added LSST_DDS_DOMAIN environment variable to allow DDS partitioning to 
isolate users when testing on the same network.



Changes for 3.4

Added generic Event types
Added Java controller tests
Added m2ms Telemetry items
Added ocs commands

Changes for 3.3

Add Dome commandable sub-systems for the major elements

Changes for 3.2.1 : 

Passed comprehensive Continuous Integration Python tests

Added LSST_[subsystem]_ID environment variable to select required instance
of subsytem at runtime (used for hexapod and rotator currently)

The Python interface has been modified to incorporate control of the Global Interpreter Lock
(GIL) to allow the DDS threads sufficient cpu time under high load conditions.

Changes for 3.2.0 : 

Passed initial Continuous Integration Python tests

Changes for 3.1.1 : 

Added SWIG based code generation option.

Passed Continuous Integration C++ tests
