<H2>2.0 CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS</H2>
<H2>2.1 System Overview</H2>
<BR>
The publish-subscribe communications model provides a more efficient model for broad data distribution over a network than point-to-point, client-server, and distributed object models. Rather than each node directly addressing other nodes to exchange data, publish-subscribe provides a communications layer that delivers data transparently from the nodes publishing the data to the nodes subscribing to the data.
Publishers send events to the communications layer, which in turn, passes the events to subscribers. In this way, a single event published by a publisher can be sent to multiple subscribers. Events are categorized by topic, and subscribers specify the topics they are interested in. Only events that match a subscribers topic are sent to that subscriber. The service permits selection of a number of quality-of-service criteria to allow applications to choose the appropriate trade-off between reliability and performance.
<P>
The combination of Client-Server and Publish-Subscribe models leads to the concept of Command/Action/Response model, in that the transmission of commands is decoupled from the action that executes that command. A command will return immediately; the action begins in a separate thread. Figure 3 illustrate this model by means of a simplified sequence diagram. When an application receives a command, it validates the attributes associated with that command and immediately accepts or rejects the command. If the command is accepted, the application then initiates an independent internal action to meet the conditions imposed by the command. Once those conditions have been met, an event is posted signifying the successful completion of the action (or the unsuccessful completion if the condition not be met). In this figure, callbacks are implemented using the event features of the publish-subscribe model.
<P>
<IMG SRC="omg.jpg"><P>
Information flows with the aid of the following constructs : Publisher and DataWriter
on the sending side, Subscriber, and DataReader on the receiving side.
<P>
A Publisher is an object responsible for data distribution. It may publish data of
different data types. A DataWriter acts as a typed4 accessor to a publisher. The
DataWriter is the object the application must use to communicate to a publisher the
existence and value of data-objects of a given type. When data-object values have
been communicated to the publisher through the appropriate data-writer, it is the
publisher's responsibility to perform the distribution (the publisher will do this
according to its own QoS, or the QoS attached to the corresponding data-writer). A
publication is defined by the association of a data-writer to a publisher. This
association expresses the intent of the application to publish the data described by
the data-writer in the context provided by the publisher.
<P>
A Subscriber is an object responsible for receiving published data and making it
available (according to the Subscribers QoS) to the receiving application. It may
receive and dispatch data of different specified types. To access the received data,
the application must use a typed DataReader attached to the subscriber. Thus, a
subscription is defined by the association of a data-reader with a subscriber. This
association expresses the intent of the application to subscribe to the data described
by the data-reader in the context provided by the subscriber.
<P>
Topic objects conceptually fit between publications and subscriptions. Publications must
be known in such a way that subscriptions can refer to them unambiguously. A Topic is
meant to fulfill that purpose: it associates a name (unique in the domain), a data-type,
and QoS related to the data itself. In addition to the topic QoS, the QoS of the
DataWriter associated with that Topic and the QoS of the Publisher associated to the
DataWriter control the behavior on the publisher's side, while the corresponding Topic,
DataReader, and Subscriber QoS control the behavior on the subscribers side.
<P>
When an application wishes to publish data of a given type, it must create a Publisher
(or reuse an already created one) and a DataWriter with all the characteristics of the
desired publication. Similarly, when an application wishes to receive data, it must create
a Subscriber (or reuse an already created one) and a DataReader to define the
subscription.
<P>
QoS (Quality of Service) is a general concept that is used to specify the behavior of a
service. Programming service behavior by means of QoS settings offers the advantage
that the application developer only indicates what is wanted rather than how this QoS
should be achieved. Generally speaking, QoS is comprised of several QoS policies. Each
QoS policy is then an independent description that associates a name with a value.
Describing QoS by means of a list of independent QoS policies gives rise to more
flexibility.
<P>
This specification is designed to allow a clear separation between the publish and the
subscribe sides, so that an application process that only participates as a publisher can
embed just what strictly relates to publication. Similarly, an application process that
participates only as a subscriber can embed only what strictly relates to subscription.
<P>
Underlying any data-centric publish subscribe system is a data model. This model
defines the global data space and specifies how Publishers and Subscribers refer to
portions of this space. The data-model can be as simple as a set of unrelated data structures,
each identified by a topic and a type. The topic provides an identifier that
uniquely identifies some data items within the global data space. The type provides
structural information needed to tell the middleware how to manipulate the data and also
allows the middleware to provide a level of type safety. However, the target applications
often require a higher-level data model that allows expression of aggregation and
coherence relationships among data elements.
<P>

The OCS Middleware provides multiple levels of access to the functionality
provided. It is recommended that the highest level methods be utilized
whenever possible. <P>
The access levels are : 
<UL>
<LI>SAL (Software abstraction layer)
<LI>SIMD/jSIMD (Simplified DDS)
<LI>OMG DDS (Data Distribution Service)
<LI>OMG RTPS (Real-time Publish Subscribe) - not used directly at present
</UL>

Each subsequent layer provides more detailed access to the low-level details
of the configuration and control of the datastream definitions and/or tuning of
real-time behavior.



<P>
<BR>
<H3>2.2	SAL (Service abstraction layer)</H3>

The SAL provides the highest level of access to the Middleware functionality.<P>
Transparent access to telemetry and command objects residing on any<BR>
subsystem is provided via means of automatic shared memory mapping of the <BR>
underlying data objects.
<P> The lower level objects are managed using an implementation<BR>
of the OMG's DDS. 
<P>The currently selected implementation is OpenSplice DDS, but the existence
of the SAL permits flexibility in migrating to other DDS solutions if required.
<P>
The SAL provides direct access to only a small subset of the total functionality<BR>
provided by the DDS, reducing both the amount of code required, and it's<BR>
complexity, as seen by the application programmer.

The OMG DDS standard is an evolving entity. It is expected that the prototype SIMD/jSIMD
API's referenced below, will be replaced by agreed OMG standards of equivalent
functionality.

VirtualBox session. Once the VM is running, it will provide<BR>
a browser based interface. <BR>
<P>
The initial page look like this
<P>
<IMG SRC="vm-reg.gif"><P>

Once the user has registered the VM instance, then data<BR>
definition tasks can be started. review the instructions<BR>
<P>
<IMG SRC="vm-datadef.gif"><P>
then click on the "Datastream Definition Editor".<BR>

The editor page is prepopulated with the default set of <BR>
datastream definitions. For each datastream there are<BR>
3 choices of activity.<BR>
<P>
<IMG SRC="vm-datadef2.gif"><P>
To edit the definition, choose the "Edit contents" option.<BR>
For example, selecting tcs_kernel_Target would open to a page like this<BR>

Simulation setup is performed using a form where each datastream<BR>
or commanding participant in a subsystem can be allocated to <BR>
a different computer.<P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="vm-sim1.gif">
<P>
Once the simulation definition has been completed, the VM builds
all the appropriate libraries and test executables. A simulation<BR>
deployment script is created. This script is designed to be run <BR>
from the SAL VM, either by logging in to an ssh terminal session, <BR>
or by connecting to the built-in VNC desktop. For example

<H3>2.4	OMG DDS</H3>
The OMG Data-Distribution Service (DDS) is a specification for publish-subscribe data-distribution systems. The purpose of the specification is to provide a common application-level interface that clearly defines the data-distribution service. The specification describes the service using UML, providing a platform-independent model that can then be mapped into a variety of concrete platforms and programming languages.
<P>
The goal of the DDS specification is to facilitate the efficient distribution of data in a distributed system. Participants using DDS can read and write data efficiently and naturally with a typed interface. Underneath, the DDS middleware will distribute the data so that each reading participant can access the most-current values. In effect, the service creates a global data space that any participant can read and write. It also creates a name space to allow participants to find and share objects.
<P>
DDS targets real-time systems; the API and QoS are chosen to balance predictable behavior and implementation efficiency/performance.

<H4>2.5 DDS Tools</H4>
<H4>2.5.1 Code generation</H4>
The DDS standard provides an source code generation tool, the IDL Pre-Processor (idlpp)
which can generate DSS interface code for a variety of language/environment combinations.
We use the "standalone C++", and "standalone Java" variants.
<P>
<H4>Opensplice Gateway</H4>
The OpenSplice Gateway provides semi-automated message translation between a 
large number of middleware systems.
<P>
By leveraging the Apache Camel integration framework and its support for over 80 connectors, the OpenSplice Gateway is the best choice for integrating DDS-interoperable applications with proprietary as well as standards-based messaging technologies, such as JMS and AMQP, as well as user applications leveraging Web standards such as W3C Web Services, REST and HTML5 WebSockets.<P>
 It's potential use is still being evaluated.

<P>
<H4>2.5.2 Debug</H4>
<H4>Opensplice Tuner</H4>
The OpenSplice Tuner is a deployment tool within PrismTech's OpenSplice DDS suite. This tool offers total control over a deployed OpenSplice based DDS-system from any local or remote platform that supports the Java language.
<P>
The Java based OpenSplice Tuner tool aids the design, implementation, test and maintenance of OpenSplice based distributed systems (the OpenSplice Tuner is available both as a 'standalone' Java-program as well as an Eclipse plug-in for the Productivity tool suite).
<P>
The OpenSplice Tuner's features target all lifecycle stages of distributed system development and can be summarized as:
<P><UL>
<LI>    Design: During the design phase, once the information model is established (i.e. topics are defined and 'registered' in a runtime environment, which can be both a host-environment as well as a target-environment), the Tuner allows creation of publishers/writers and subscribers/readers on the fly to experiment and validate how this data should be treated by the middleware regarding persistence, durability, latency, etc.
<LI>    Implementation: During the implementation phase, where actual application-level processing and distribution of this information is developed, the OpenSplice Tuner allows injection of test input-data by creating publishers and writers 'on the fly' as well as validating the responses by creating subscribers and readers for any produced topics.
<LI>    Test: during the test phase, the total system can be monitored by inspection of data (by making 'snapshots' of writer- and reader-history caches) and behavior of readers & writers (statistics, like how long data has resided in the reader's cache before it was read) as well as monitoring of the data-distribution behavior (memory-usage, transport-latencies).
<LI>    Maintenance: Maximum flexibility for planned and 'ad-hoc' maintenance is offered by allowing the Tuner tool (which can be executed on any JAVA enabled platform without the need of OpenSplice to be installed) to remotely connect via the web-based SOAP protocol to any 'reachable' OpenSplice system around the world (as long a HTTP-connection can be established with the OpenSplice computing-nodes of that system).  Using such a dynamic-connection, critical data may be logged and data-sets may be 'injected' into the system to be maintained (such as new settings which can be automatically 'persisted' using the QoS features as offered by the 'persistence-profile supported by OpenSplice).

<H4>DDS Benchmark Environment</H4>
DBE is the DDS Benchmarking Environment is used to test the DDS implementation. The DBE consists of scripts to automate test running on a distributed network. These scripts are written in Perl and use NFS partitions to synchronize and log results. The DBE is the kernel of what may later become a unified testing architecture for any type of middleware.<P>

<H3>2.6	OMG RTPS wire protocol</H3>
<B>The RTPS layer is NOT expected to be used directly by any project generated code, 
we included a brief description for completeness.</B><P>

The Real-Time Publish Subscribe (RTPS) protocol has its roots in industrial automation and was approved by the IEC as part of the Real-Time Industrial Ethernet Suite IEC-PAS-62030. It is a field proven technology that is currently deployed worldwide in thousands of industrial devices.
RTPS was specifically developed to support the unique requirements of data-distributions systems. 
<P>
As one of the application domains targeted by DDS, the industrial automation community defined requirements for a standard publish subscribe wire-protocol that closely match those of DDS. 
There is a close synergy between DDS and the RTPS wire-protocol, both in terms of the underlying behavioral architecture and the features of RTPS.
<P>
The RTPS protocol is designed to be able to run over multicast and connectionless best-effort transports such as UDP/IP. The main features of the RTPS protocol include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Performance and quality-of-service properties to enable best-effort and reliable publish-subscribe communications for real-time applications over standard IP networks.
<LI>Fault tolerance to allow the creation of networks without single points of failure.
<LI>Extensibility to allow the protocol to be extended and enhanced with new services without breaking backwards compatibility and interoperability.
<LI>Plug-and-play connectivity so that new applications and services are automatically discovered and applications can join and leave the network at any time without the need for reconfiguration.
<LI>Reconfigurability to allow balancing the requirements for reliability and timeliness for each data delivery.
<LI>Modularity to allow simple devices to implement a subset of the protocol and still participate in the network.
<LI>Scalability to enable systems to potentially scale to very large networks.
<LI>Type-safety to prevent application programming errors from compromising the operation of remote nodes.
</UL>
<P>
The above features make RTPS an excellent match for a DDS wire-protocol. Given its publish
subscribe roots, this is not a coincidence, as RTPS was specifically designed for meeting the types of requirements set forth by the DDS application domain.
<P>
This specification defines the message formats, interpretation, and usage scenarios that underlie all messages exchanged by applications that use the RTPS protocol.
<P>

<H2>2.7 Security and Integrity</H2>
<BR>
<H4>2.7.1 General policies</H4>

Refer to  http://dev.lsstcorp.org/trac/attachment/wiki/Security/Security Policy documents.zip<P>

<H4>2.7.2 Firewall</H4>
A firewall's basic task is to regulate the flow of traffic between computer networks of different trust levels. Typical examples are the Internet which is a zone with no trust and an internal network which is a zone of higher trust. A zone with an intermediate trust level, situated between the Internet and a trusted internal network, is often referred to as a perimeter network or Demilitarized zone (DMZ).

<H4>2.7.3 Packet filtering</H4>
Packet filters act by inspecting the packets which represent the basic unit of data transfer between computers on the Internet. If a packet matches the packet filter's set of rules, the packet filter will drop (silently discard) the packet, or reject it (discard it, and send error responses to the source).
<P>
This type of packet filtering pays no attention to whether a packet is part of an existing stream of traffic (it stores no information on connection state). Instead, it filters each packet based only on information contained in the packet itself (most commonly using a combination of the packet's source and destination address, its protocol, and, for TCP and UDP traffic, which comprises most internet communication, the port number).
<P>
Because TCP and UDP traffic by convention uses well known ports for particular types of traffic, a stateless packet filter can distinguish between, and thus control, those types of traffic (such as web browsing, remote printing, email transmission, file transfer), unless the machines on each side of the packet filter are both using the same non-standard ports.
Second Generation firewalls do not simply examine the contents of each packet on an individual basis without regard to their placement within the packet series as their predecessors had done, rather they compare some key parts of the trusted database packets. This technology is generally referred to as a 'stateful firewall' as it maintains records of all connections passing through the firewall, and is able to determine whether a packet is the start of a new connection, or part of an existing connection. Though there is still a set of static rules in such a firewall, the state of a connection can in itself be one of the criteria which trigger specific rules.
<P>
This type of firewall can help prevent attacks which exploit existing connections, or certain Denial-of-service attacks, including the SYN flood which sends improper sequences of packets to consume resources on systems behind a firewall.
<P>
<H4>2.7.4 Private subnet</H4>
Firewalls often have network address translation (NAT) functionality, and the hosts protected behind a firewall commonly have addresses in the private address range, as defined in RFC 1918. Firewalls often have such functionality to hide the true address of protected hosts. Originally, the NAT function was developed to address the limited amount of IPv4 routable addresses that could be used or assigned to companies or individuals as well as reduce both the amount and therefore cost of obtaining enough public addresses for every computer in an organization. Hiding the addresses of protected devices has become an increasingly important defense against network reconnaissance.


<H4>2.7.5 DDS domains</H4>
The domain is the basic construct used to bind
individual applications together for
communication. A distributed application can
elect to use a single domain for all its data-centric
communications. 
<P>
All Data Writers and Data Readers with like data
types will communicate within this domain.
DDS also has the capability to support multiple
domains, thus providing developers a system that
can scale with system needs or segregate based
on different data types. When a specific data
instance is published on one domain, it will not
be received by subscribers residing on any other
domains.
<P>
Multiple domains provide effective data
isolation. One use case would be for a system to
be designed whereby all Command/Control
related data is exchanged via one domain while
Status information is exchanged within another. 
Multiple domains are also a good way to control
the introduction of new functionality into an
existing system.
<P>



<H2>3.0 DETAILED INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS</H2>
<H2> 3.1 Commanding Requirements</H2>
There are two basic classes of commands used :
Lifecycle commands : commands used by OCS to control the lifecycle
characteristics of applications. Users generally do not need to be concerned with the lifecycle commands because they are implemented by the underlying infrastructure.
<P>
Functional commands : commands that implement the specific functional characteristics of a
subsystem components.
<P>
Functional operation is based on the Command/Action/Response model that isolates the transmission of the command from the resulting action that is performed. When an application receives a command, it validates any Configuration associated with that command and immediately accepts or rejects the command. If the command is accepted, the application then initiates an independent internal action to meet the conditions imposed by the command. Once those conditions have been met, an event is posted signifying the successful completion of the action (or the unsuccessful completion if the conditions can not be met).
<P>
Commands return immediately but the actions that are initiated as a result of a command may take some time to complete. When the action completes, an action status event is posted that includes the completion status of that action. The subsystem generating the command monitors this status event prior to issuing the command on the remote system. While the monitoring is performed automatically by the command system, Subsystem developers may need to attach a callback to perform processing on action completion. This callback may be null if no processing is needed.
<P>
If a command is accepted by the subsystem it causes an independent action to begin. A response to the command is returned immediately. The action begins matching the current configuration to the new demand configuration. When the configurations match (i.e., the subsystem has performed the input operations) the action signals the successful end of the action. If the configurations cannot be matched (whether by hardware failure, external stop command, timeout, or some other fault) the action signals the unsuccessful end of the action.
<P>
The important features of the command/action/response model are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Commands are never blocked. As soon as one command is started, another one can be issued. The
behavior of the controller when two or more configurations are started can be configured on a
per subsystem basis.
<LI>The actions are performed using one or more separate threads. They can be tuned for priority, number of
simultaneous actions, critical resources, or any other parameters.
<LI>Action completions produce events that tell the state of the current configuration. Actions push the lifecycle of the configuration through to completion.
<LI>Responses may be monitored by any other subsystems.<P>

<H3> 3.2 Telemetry Requirements</H3>
Telemetry data issued via the middleware must be received by the computer system(s)
of the Facility database , and any other subscribers , within TDB ms. 

<H3> 3.3 Event Notifications Requirements</H3>
Any application may
post notifications and/or subscribe to notifications posted elsewhere. The notification service is robust and high performance. A notification consists of a topic and a severity. A sequence of notifications with the same topic is referred to as an event.
<P>
The topic is used to identify publishers to subscribers. The severity may be used as a filter
by notification subscribers.
<P>
The notification service has the following general properties:
An notification topic represents a many to many mapping: notifications may be posted to the topic from more than one source and received by zero or more targets. (Typically, however, most topics will have a single source.)
<P>
Notifications posted by a single source into an notification topic are received by all targets in the same order as they were posted.
<P>
Delivery of notifications to one subscriber cannot be blocked by the actions of another subscriber.
An notification stream is an abstract concept: a subscriber may subscribe to an notification stream using a wildcarded name in which case the notifications it receives are the merging of all published notifications whose names match that wildcarded name. 
<P>
Notification are not queued by the service. A late subscriber will not see earlier notifications.
<P>
The service does not drop notifications. A published notification will be delivered to all subscribers.
<P>
The notification service supports arbitrary notification topics.
<P>
Notifications are automatically tagged with the source and a timestamp.

<P>
<P>
<H3>3.4.2 Flow Control : DDS topics</H3>

Topics provide the basic connection point
between publishers and subscribers. The Topic of
a given publisher on one node must match the
Topic of an associated subscriber on any other
node. If the Topics do not match, communication
will not take place.
<P>
A Topic is comprised of a Topic Name and a
Topic Type. The Topic Name is a string that
uniquely identifies the Topic within a domain.
The Topic Type is the definition of the data
contained within the Topic. Topics must be
uniquely defined within any one particular
domain. Two Topics with different Topic Names
but the same Topic Type definition would be
considered two different Topics within the DDS
infrastructure.
<P>
<H3> 3.5 Security Requirements</H3>
<H3>3.5.1 Message timestamps</H3>

Message integrity is enhanced by the inclusion of egress-time and
arrival time (local system clocks) field in every topic
(command , notification, and telemetry). The SAL software
automatically performs validation to ensure early
detection of clock slew or other time related problems.

<H3>3.5.2 Software versioning checksums</H3>

Communications consistency and security is supported by the
inclusion of CRC checksum fields in every topic
definition (command , notification, and telemetry).
The SAL software automatically checks that the publisher and
subscribers are running code generated using identical 
(at the source code level) topic definitions. This prevents
problems associated with maintaining consistent inter-subsystem
interfaces across a widely distributed software development
infrastructure.



<H2>4.0 QUALIFICATION METHODS</H2>

<H3>4.1 System dictionary</H3>

A systemwide dictionary of all subsystems, devices, 
actions and states is maintained. All the interactions
between subsystems are automatically checked to verify
that only objects defined in the dictionary can be
used or referenced. See Appendix A.

<H3>4.2 Command definition database</H3>

A database of permissible commands is maintained
on a per subsystem basis. The database references the
system dictionary and contains 1 record per command.
Each command is constrained in terms of target
subsystems, parameter ranges, maximum frequency, 
timeout, pause/hold potential,and failure severity.
<P>
The database is used to automatically generate 
application level code to perform all command
level interactions. This code is thus guaranteed to be
consistent system wide. See Appendix C


<H3>4.3 Telemetry datastream Definition database</H3>

All telemetry datastream definitions are stored in a 
database. Each definition is automatically verified
for compliance with the system dictionary. Telemetry
items are detailed in terms of type, size, frequency, 
units, and value ranges. Any item with a physical 
correlate has an SI unit associated with it. 
<P>
The database is used to automatically generate 
application level code to perform all datastream
topic references. This code is thus guaranteed to be
consistent system wide. See Appendix B
<P>
Events are generated using the same database, and comprise
a special category of topics which may assigned the highest
priority (ALERT category) if appropriate.
<P>

<H3>4.4 Code generation</H3>
The primary implementation of the software interface described in this
document will be automatically generated. A software abstraction layer
(SAL) will provide a standardized wrapper for the low-level OMG DDS 
functionality which provides the transport layer. 
<P>
The permissible commands, datastream contents, and issuable alerts are
all defined by the controls system database and their nomenclature is controlled
by the system dictionary. All intersubsystem messages formats are
autogenerated. Low level data transfers include versioning checksums
based on the source level record definition.
<P>
<H3>4.5 Testing and simulation</H3>
Test servers and clients are generated which implement the full
set of commands, datastreams, and notifications are defined by
the controls system database. Tests may be configured for a 
variable number of servers/clients and automatically monitored
to ensure compliance with bandwidth and latency requirements.
All test results are archived to the facility database for 
future examination.

Each device in a system or subsystem may have many different
properties associated with it. Properties are used for both
control and monitoring purposes.  ie Some properties may be
controlled; others may only monitored. In general, if a property can
be controlled there should also be another  item to allow monitoring so
that both the target and actual properties are logged.<P>

<LI>     Shutter life test unit/testbed
<LI>     Shutter storage/transport container
<LI>     Test gantry and sensor array<P>
<P>
A rectangular aperture that moves across the array controls the exposure time for all pixels. Equal exposure time requires the opening edge and the closing edge to have the same motion profile in time. This is achieved by using one long sheet with a central rectangular aperture of constant width. For compact storage, the sheet attaches to and wraps around two rollers to form a scroll. Tthere are two closed positions so the sheet advances in the same direction from closed to open to closed. The sheet reverses direction for the next cycle.  This would be of great benefit if the minimum exposure time were much shorter than currently required. 
<P>
Controlling the exposure time to millisecond precision is equivalent to controlling position of the aperture edges to several tenths of millimeters. Standard feedforward and feedback control techniques  maintain acceptable following error (i.e., the controller component of error) for this well defined motion profile. Placing sensors on the rollers is easy and reliable and the average of the two accounts for the effective roller radius changing as the sheet rolls up on itself. This effect is small for a thin metal sheet. In addition, a metal sheet is opaque, does not outgas, can be processed for high fatigue strength and low wear, and is stable and rigid in plane.<P><UL>

This subsystem comprises the science image sensors (201 CCDs), the front end electronics, the back end electronics, and a collection of electronics boards on a common bus along with the power supplies, cabling, fiber outputs, etc. needed to operate the CCDs in the science array. The 201 CCDs fully populate 21 focal plane rafts with 9 CCDs each and partially populate 4 rafts with 3 CCDs each. A dedicated state machine based controller issues timing and control signals to Camera Electronics. Specifically, it controls all signals required by both Front End Cards and Back End Cards. These include all CCD clocks, Signal Processing ASIC timing/control signals, A to D conversion control signals on the Back End, and so forth. Note that sensor data is normally not returned to the SAC, but is routed out of the camera on multiple Data Fibers. The control module for this subsystem would run on an embedded processor providing an interface between the CCM and the dedicated state machine based controller.<P><UL>

The Thermal Control (TCS) manager software controls temperature in multiple thermal zones in the focal plane, cryostat, and camera body.  Feedback control is based on trim heaters for actuation and temperature sensors for readback.<P>
<P>Temperature monitoring  for sensors located in the camera
subsystem.<BR>Raw sensor readings, calibrated temperatures,

<P>
The basic requirement of the Camera Thermal Comtrol System is to allow the solidstate
detectors that form the Focal Plane Array (FPA) to operate at ~ 170K to reduce the contribution of thermal noise to the electronic signals while in parallel optimizing
quantum efficiency (QE). The thermal gradient across the sensors must also be adequately
reduced (±0.30K) to maintain uniform quantum efficiency in each pixel. For efficient camera
operation, thermal stability of the FPA is necessary to maintain optical sensor performance as well as to eliminate the growth of mechanical distortions to the FPA, once it is aligned. 
<P>
The additional functions of the thermal control system are to provide a particulate free environment for the sensor surfaces, heat extraction from both the front end and back end electronics systems, and antifog protection for the three optical elements.   The camera is composed of a cryostat containing the FPA and its readout electronics and an outer camera body which houses the cryostat, shutter, L2 optic, and the five filters and filter exchange mechanism. The cryostat is closed by the L3 optic and the outer camera body by the L1 optic. The cryostat is operated at ~10e-6 Torr vacuum while the region between the cryostat and outer body will contain an inert gas (eg: dry nitrogen will be assumed) regulated to be slightly above atmospheric pressure. The temperature of the N2 gas will be controlled to maintain a stable thermal envelope. The other important role of the inert gas is to prevent degradation of the filter coatings.

All analog signals  are buffered and fully differential for purposes of noise immunity. Similarly, all timing signals comply with the Low Voltage Differential Signaling (LVDS) standard. Both the clock drivers and the bias generators will be programmable by means of a slow serial link.<P><UL>

<H3>Telemetry datastream topic : camera.VCS</H3><P>
The Vacuum Control Subsystem (VCS) manager software controls and synchronizes operation of the vacuum and purge subsystem in the camera cryostat and utility trunk (either on the mountain or in the lab).  Feedback control is based on vacuum pumps and pressure gauges.
<P>This subsystem maintains application level data for the dewar<BR>vacuum
systems. Target and actual statuses<BR>health , limits, etc.
<P>
The inner cryostat housing contains the focal plane array with its frontend and backend electronics, elements of the thermal management system, and all lectrical, optical, fluid and mechanical feedthroughs. The lens, L3, forms the window on the ront end of the cryostat housing. A rear flange to the inner housing provides primary access to components inside.
<P>
<LI>On Camera vacuum manifolds, valves, pump ports, transfer lines, and plena. Getter and ion holding pumps on
Cryostat, including regeneration heaters and valving. RGA, ion gauge, TQCM, and controllers.
<LI>On Camera purge manifolds, valves, pump ports, and pressure vessel. Metering, temp sensors, reheaters, power
supplies and controllers. Insulated purge flex lines to camera.
<LI>On the ground: Purge reheat controller, chiller, meters, filters, sensors, flow control valves, racks and consoles.
<P>The focal plane array is contained in vacuum to minimize its environmental heat load. While vacuum eliminates natural convection, other modes of heat transfer are still present. Multi layer insulation applied to the cryostat housing all but eliminates radiation heat transfer except where it cannot be such as the vacuum window (L3). Supporting the focal plane array on flexures naturally minimizes conduction through structures.<P><UL>

Wavefront System Manager
<P>This subsystem maintains metadata concerning the state of the<BR>wavefront
sensors, and the results of the processing of<BR>images. Items such
as chip voltages, health, per chip temps<BR>bad pixel/line/column
counts, image pair counts, zernike results<BR>and so on. 
The wavefront sensing system will consist of wavefront curvature monitors and/or Shack Hartmann sensors in or around
the science array. Data from these sensors will be used to monitor and improve the quality of the science data by using WF
measurements for feedback compensation. The feedback control of telescope alignment will be handled by the
Telescope Control System.
<P>
Four special purpose rafts, mounted at the corners of the science array, will contain wavefront sensors and guide sensors.
Wavefront measurements are accomplished using curvature sensing, where the spatial intensity distribution of stars is
measured at equal distances on either side of focus. Each curvature sensor will be composed of two CCD detectors, with
one positioned slightly above the focal plane, and the other positioned slightly below the focal plane. The CCD technology
for the curvature sensors will be identical to that used for the science detectors in the focal plane except that the curvature
sensor detectors will be half size so they can be mounted as an in/out defocus pair. Detailed analyses have verified that this
configuration can recover the wavefront to the required accuracy.
