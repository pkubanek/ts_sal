set DESC(tcs) "The main purpose of the Telescope Control System (TCS) software is to accept the target position of a celestial object, which can be given in a variety of coordinate systems, and calculate mount, rotator and optical surface positions, so that the target is imaged perfectly at a given point in the focal plane. Furthermore, the TCS is characterized by the need to integrate a number of heterogeneous subsystems, which exhibit complex interactions. These interactions, although not hard realtime bounded, need a high level of synchronization.
<P>
The Telescope Control System (TCS) is the central coordination facility for the delivery of high quality field images to the camera. It is responsible for the precise pointing and tracking calculations necessary to observe a certain field. The TCS does not itself operate any mechanical component; rather it delegates this responsibility to the various telescope subsystems and manages them according to the observation requests.
<P>
The TCS design is based on a distributed system model. Under this model, the components
interact through well defined interfaces, to accomplish the desired system behavior. The maincomponents in the proposed implementation, are tied together by the use of an Ethernet Bus, thus permitting the efficient exchange of commands and status among them.
<P>
The distributed nature of the TCS is complemented by the control model based on a
supervisory control strategy. Under this model, a supervisor agent computes the “setpoint” to be applied to a controllable device. The time critical loops are closed locally at the device level, and the device makes status information available for monitoring purposes.
<P>
The TCS itself will be controlled either directly by a telescope operator, or by commands
initiated by the Observatory Control System (OCS). Its role therefore, is to act as intermediary between the observer(s) and the telescope hardware, translating high level user commands into low level subsystem commands. Consistent with our control model, the TCS will return status information to be distributed system wide."


set DESC(activeOptics) "
<P>Optical Reconstructor. The optical reconstructor component computes optics aberrations,
normally in the form of zernike coefficients, from the images, or image segments, that will be provided by the CCS at a rate to be determined. The reconstructor will generate surface and position corrections, to be applied to the active optics components. Even though the final details of the interactions between optics, WFS and CCS are as yet to be determined, the present control model should apply as well, in that setpoints will be generated for the optics, CCS and mount components."





set DESC(camera) "The camera is one of the three primary LSST technical subsystems (along with the Telescope/Site Subsystem and the
Data Management Subsystem). It contains a 3.2 Gigapixel focal plane array, comprised of roughly 200 4K x 4K CCD
sensors, with 10 micron pixels. 
<P>The sensors are deep depleted, back illuminated devices with a highly segmented
architecture that enables the entire array to be read out in 2 s or less. These detectors are grouped into 3 x 3 arrays called
rafts. Each raft contains its own dedicated front end and back end electronics boards, which fit within the footprint of its
sensors, thus serving as a 144 Megapixel camera on its own. 
<P>All of the rafts, with their associated electronics, are mounted
on a silicon carbide grid inside a vacuum cryostat, with an intricate thermal control system that maintains the CCDs at an
operating temperature of roughly minus 90 degrees centigrade.
<P>The grid also contains sets of guide sensors and wavefront
sensors at the edge of the field. The entire grid, with the sensors, is actuated at a rate ~ 30 Hz in a fast guiding mode to
maintain a very narrow psf (0.7 arcseconds median), which is limited mainly by seeing fluctuations in the overlying
atmosphere.
<P>The entrance window to the cryostat is the third of the three refractive lenses. The other two lenses are mounted in an optics
structure at the front of the camera body. The camera body also contains a mechanical shutter, and a carrousel assembly
that holds five large optical filters, any of which can be inserted into the camera field of view for a given exposure. A sixth
optical filter will also be fabricated which can replace any of the five via an automated procedure accomplished during
daylight hours.
<P>
The camera system consists of multiple subsystems that include utilities, the camera body vessel and mechanisms for
shuttering and optical filtering, the imaging sensors, optical lenses and filters, a computerized data acquisition and control
system, the cryostat holding the detector array, readout and control electronics, wavefront sensors, and guide sensors."

set DESC(dome) "Dome and dome<BR>
1.1.Basic Functions: The purpose of the dome is to protect the telescope and camera from adverse environmental conditions both during observing and when not in operation.  The clear optical path provided by the dome, the contribution of dome seeing to the overall error budget, and the operational parameters of the dome will be consistent with the Telescope Requirements Document (Doc # 2389)
<P>Thermally Benign: A fundamental objective in the dome design will be maintaining a beneficial thermal environment for the seeing performance of the telescope.  Preconditioning of the telescope environment, passive ventilation, the use of materials with low thermal inertia, and other strategies will be employed for that purpose.
<P>Special LSST Survey Requirements: As a telescope dedicated to a demanding survey program, LSST has some special characteristics that are reflected in the dome requirements:
A critical need to shield the telescope from stray light due to the wide 3.5º telescope observing angle
A higher than normal requirement for dome reliability imposed by the continuous nature of the survey observing regime. 
A faster than normal dome tracking speed required by the rapid paced, robotic observing cadence.
<P>
Maintenance: In addition to its operational characteristics, the dome provides adequate enclosed space and appropriate facilities for engineering and maintenance work on the telescope, camera, and on the dome itself.
<P>
Coordination with Telescope, Optics and Instrument Design: Designs for the telescope mount, optics, and camera are ongoing.  The baseline dimensions and operational characteristics of these elements are, however, well enough understood to allow development of an appropriate dome to enclose and service these systems.  Further refinements in telescope and camera design will be incorporated into future versions of this document, and later reflected in the detailed design of the dome.
<P>
Coordination with the Lower dome: The lower dome that supports the dome is a fixed building with requirements described in the Support Facility Design Requirements Document (Doc # 342). The dimensional and structural criteria for the lower dome are dictated by the dome.
<P>
Code Compliance and Structural Loads:  All aspects of the LSST dome will comply with current editions of the International Building Code, OSHA regulations, and other applicable design and construction standards as specified by LSST.  Wind and seismic loads for dome design will be developed based on the latest available historical and regional data.
<P>
Site: The LSST observatory will be located at the El Peñón peak on Cerro Pachón in Chile.  This is a mountaintop location at an elevation of approximately 2650m (8692 ft.) above sea level, and is subject to severe weather conditions.  This site is also subject to relatively high earthquake risk, with correspondingly high design factors for seismic acceleration.   The dome will be designed to withstand these and other specific environmental conditions of the site."

set DESC(m1m3) "Primary mirror system<P>
The primary is made from spun cast borosilicate blanks cast at the University
of Arizona’s Mirror Laboratory. These mirrors will use the standard hex cell pattern so the existing load spreader
designs can be used without modification. The arrangement of actuators and load spreaders has been adjusted near the
ID of the primary to adapt to the large center hole and the arrangement on the tertiary is adjusted as required at the OD.
Since we assume the use of the same support actuators as are in service on the LBT 8.4 m primary, the test data from
this set of actuators is relevant to the evaluation of support force errors.
<P>
Weight of the primary is 12,526 kg.
This includes the weight of the bonded on
load spreaders. Primary results are based on frequent
system corrections for focus, coma and astigmatism. The
primary benefits from this due to a relatively soft
astigmatic bending mode attributable to the large center
hole. This correction, while desirable, is not necessary."

set DESC(m2ms) "Secondary mirror system
<P>This mirror is
designed to be made from an existing 350 mm thick Zerodur blank. It is a bit thinner than would be needed to provide a
completely passive support (one that would never need to have the surface figure measured and corrected by adjusting
the actuator forces). The secondary has a back sheet thickness of 3.81 cm (1.5 inches), and a face sheet of similar
thickness except near the OD where the fabrication process requires that the internal surface of the face sheet be
parallel to the back surface resulting in an increase in the average face sheet thickness toward the OD. . It is approximately 63% lightweighted.
The LSST secondary is axially supported through load spreaders and pucks bonded to the back of the mirror . Fourteen three puck load spreaders are used along with 62 single puck actuator interfaces. A single axial
actuator loads the six inner three puck load spreaders. Two axial actuators load four of the three puck load spreaders
and three axial actuators load the remaining four. The three puck loadspreaders loaded by multiple actuators are
provided where static supports are used since these require the three puck frame to carry lateral loads. All load
spreaders are similar to the loadspreaders already in use on 6.5 and 8.4 m primary mirrors and consist of an Invar 36
frame bolted to puck assemblies that are bonded to the mirror with a 4 mm layer of silicone adhesive (GE RTV630).
The silicone adhesive layer is perforated with 2 mm diameter holes spaced 20 mm apart to reduce the axial stiffness of
the bond to approximately 120 kN/mm. Lateral support is provided at twenty of the pockets at two different depths.
The six innermost laterals support 46% of the weight 60.2 mm (2.37”) in front of the CG (center of gravity) plane. The
remaining 14 lateral supports carry 54% of the weight 82.6 mm (2.03”) behind the CG plane.
<P>
The axial support force actuators are counterweight mechanisms. 
They are equipped with load cells and an active
force capability for the compensation of thermal distortion due to
thermal expansion inhomogeneity and to provide axial correction
forces proportional to the lateral gravity component. Additionally,
forces will be adjusted to obtain the desired reactions at the position
constraints (hardpoints). Tapered roller bearings are used at all
rotating joints including the two universal joints in the connecting
rods."


set DESC(MTMount) "Telescope mount and axes<BR>
Optically the LSST telescope has a unique 3 mirror system. The primary mirror circumscribes
the tertiary mirror such that both surfaces can be made into a single monolithic substrate 
The camera assembly is also circumscribed within the secondary mirror
assembly, forming a convenient package at the telescope top end.
Although the LSST optical design is unique, it can be supported by a conventional telescope
structural arrangement. A stiff mirror cell is used to support the primary and tertiary mirrors, and the top end assembly supports both the secondary mirror assembly and the camera assembly. Both the elevation axis and the azimuth axis are expected to utilize hydrostatic bearings, which are common on large telescopes.
<P>The LSSTs structural arrangement facilitates maintainability. The primary/tertiary mirror cell is connected to the rest of the elevation assembly at four flange locations. This facilitates convenient removal and reinstallation of the mirror cell for recoating and any significant maintenance needs. The top end assembly is also only attached at four flange locations to facilitate removal. The hydrostatic bearing surfaces are enclosed to reduce contamination and susceptibility to damage.
<P>The mount design also incorporates many essential auxiliary components.
Among these are the baffle system, balancing system, damping system, mirror cover, cable wraps and motor drives. The mirror cell is a 2 m deep sandwich with access to the complex systems required for mounting and thermal control of the primary and tertiary mirrors.
<P>Preliminary analysis determined that the lowest natural frequencies of the telescope assembly should be 10 Hz or greater to meet the slew and settling requirements. The telescope mount assembly was designed and analyzed with FEA, with the goal of meeting this 10 Hz requirement. The top end assembly supports the mass of the secondary mirror assembly and camera assembly through the use of 16 hollow rectangular spiders. 
<P>
These hollow spiders are structurally efficient, and the interior provides a convenient location to route the many cables required by the camera and the secondary mirror. These spiders have exterior dimensions of 300 mm x 50 mm and interior dimensions of 210 mm x 36 mm.
<P>The spiders are arranged to minimize the image degradation. All the spiders are arranged in axially aligned pairs. Consequently, the focal plane only sees eight spiders. The eight spider pairs are in a parallel/perpendicular arrangement, which only produces 2 diffraction spikes.
<P>
The instrument assembly includes the camera, rotator, hexapod, cable wrap, integrating
structure and electronics assemblies. The rotator is located between the hexapod and the camera to provide rotation about the optical axis during tracking. The hexapod resides between the rotator and integrating structure, and is used to provide alignment and positioning. 
The electronics assemblies mount to the interior of the integrating structure. The cable wrap resides on the top of the integrating structure.
<P>
The entire instrument assembly can be installed and removed as a single unit. This allows the entire instrument assembly to be put together and tested before integration into the telescope. It also provides for the removal for service and repairs. This installation feature requires that all cabling for the camera be routed from the camera’s top surface, through the hexapod and the cable wrap and to the integrating structures top surface.
<P>
The secondary mirror assembly is a 100 mm thick glass meniscus supported by 120 axial actuators and 6 tangent actuators and a structural cell for
support. The entire secondary mirror assembly is attached to the top end spider spindle by 6
positioning actuators. The mounting system includes an interface plate to allow removal of the secondary mirror assembly without disconnecting the position actuators. 
The secondary mirror assembly also incorporates a large baffle."

set DESC(seeing_dimm) "Seeing canmera, differential image motion monitor<P>
The first DIMM was developed by M. Sarazin and F. Roddier (Sarazin, M., Roddier, F., The ESO differential image motion monitor, 1990, Astron. Astrophy. 227, 294). Refer to this paper for more complete information, especially on the theory.
<P>
Image quality through a telescope is directly related to the statistics of the perturbations of the incoming wavefront. The DIMM method consists of measuring wavefront slope differences over 2 small pupils some distance apart. Because it is a differential method, the technique is inherently insensitive to tracking errors and wind shake. In practice, starlight goes through 2 small circular subapertures, cut in a mask placed at the entrance of a small telescope. One of the subapertures contains a prism in order to create a second image of the star on the detector. The dual star images obtained exhibit a relative motion in the image plane that represents the local wavefront tilts, which can be expressed in terms of an absolute seeing scale 
<P>Sources of error:<BR>
Pixel scale: the FWHM varies as the 6/5 power of the standard deviation of the motion, which is measured in fractions of pixels. The pixel angular scale is determined typically with a 1% accuracy, leading to a 1.2% error in the FWHM.
<P>
Instrumental noise: the accuracy of the centroid algorithm, measured in laboratory on 2 fixed spots, corresponds to an equivalent random error of about 0.03 arcsec rms.
<P>
Statistical errors: it decreases with the square root of the sampling (number of images used). In our case, the variance of image motion is obtained from typically 250 short exposures per minute in each direction (i.e.. 500 in total), which leads to an accuracy of 3.8% in the image size.
<P>
Exposure time: the error caused by the finite exposure time is minimized by using very short exposures that can freeze the motion of the atmosphere in most conditions. We implemented the 5ms to 10ms (the minimum CCD frame transfer time is 1ms) interleaving technique and calculate (and log) the extrapolated seeing for a virtual integration time of 0ms (we know from ESO that 5ms is freezing the image motion 99% of the time in Chilean sites)."


set DESC(seeing_mass) "Seeing camera, Multi aperture turbulence measurement<BR>
Multi Aperture Scintillation Sensing (MASS). By correlating scintillation patterns in different annular pupils in a telescope the altitude and strength of turbulent motions in the atmosphere, where the scintillation originates, can be deduced. 
<P>
When stellar light passes through a turbulent layer and propagates down, its intensity fluctuates. Spatial scale of these variations depends on the distance to the layer. This dependence is used to separate the contributions from different layers by means of four concentric ring apertures that work as a matched spatial filter. Turbulence profile is derived from the statistical processing of the series of photon counts with 1 ms sampling.
<P>
Intensity of light falling into each of the ring apertures A, B, C, and D (see below) is measured by photon counters.  Scintillation index  in each aperture is computed as the variance (dispersion) of intensity normalized by the average intensity squared (or, equivalently, variance of the natural logarithm). In this way the scintillation index does not depend on the brightness of the star and reflects only the strength of atmospheric scintillation. Contribution of photon noise is carefully subtracted in the calculation.
<P>
Similarly, differential scintillation index for a pair of apertures (e.g. A and B) is defined as the variance of the ratio of intensities in A and B normalized by the square of the average intensity ratio A/B (or, equivalently, the variance of the natural logarithm of the intensity ratio).
<P>
Both normal and differential scintillation indices produced by a given turbulent layer are computed as product of the turbulence intensity in this layer (integral of Cn2 measured in m^1/3) by some weighting function which depends on the distance to the layer as well as on the shape and size of the apertures."

set DESC(skycam) "Sky cameras<BR>
The primary goal is to provide qualitative assessment of cloud patterns (detection, layout and motion).  Thick clouds on large spatial scales can be detected by almost any camera, but as they can also be readily seen by eye, this is not a very interesting case  ...except for remote users.  The primary goal of this project is to detect diffuse Cirrus which is more common and very difficult or impossible to see by eye in the moonless sky.    Side benefits (which I will discuss later) are aircraft detection (for laser safety), sky brightness monitoring (light pollution versus cloud cover and time of day), monitoring of OH emissions and auroras, and monitoring of clouds under moonlight or even daylight for remote observers.  Finally, the impact of high quality images of the skies over Tololo on the public, particularly the astronomical community, should not be overlooked, particularly if they are superior in quality to those offered in the North (e.g.  Mauna Kea, and Kitt Peak)
<P>
Since the dark sky is almost invariant from night to night it is possible to subtract a reference frame formed from the median of previous (dark) nights so that a nominally flat image can be displayed at sufficient contrast to allow extinction and scattering to be perceived down to the limit imposed by the photon shot noise.   This has been demonstrated crudely by derotating clear frames taken on the same night.  Much better results will be obtained when the camera remains in a fixed position from night to night so that no derotation is needed.
<P>
Pixels can be binned together to improve the noise statistics, but only until the typical spatial scale of the clouds is reached.   Unfortunately a comparison of the angular scale of daytime Cirrus with that of the the moon or an outstretched thumb will quickly confirm that  the proposed resolution of 0.18 degrees (960 pixels across the sky) is not excessive, and that only slight binning can be used if at all.  This fine angular scale and the high winds found at altitude combine to require exposure times shorter than ~3 seconds to maintain acceptable contrast for Cirrus."

The basic requirement of the Camera Thermal Comtrol System is to allow the solidstate
detectors that form the Focal Plane Array (FPA) to operate at ~ 170K to reduce the contribution of thermal noise to the electronic signals while in parallel optimizing
quantum efficiency (QE). The thermal gradient across the sensors must also be adequately
reduced (±0.30K) to maintain uniform quantum efficiency in each pixel. For efficient camera
operation, thermal stability of the FPA is necessary to maintain optical sensor performance as well as to eliminate the growth of mechanical distortions to the FPA, once it is aligned. 
<P>
The additional functions of the thermal control system are to provide a particulate free environment for the sensor surfaces, heat extraction from both the front end and back end electronics systems, and antifog protection for the three optical elements.   The camera is composed of a cryostat containing the FPA and its readout electronics and an outer camera body which houses the cryostat, shutter, L2 optic, and the five filters and filter exchange mechanism. The cryostat is closed by the L3 optic and the outer camera body by the L1 optic. The cryostat is operated at ~10e-6 Torr vacuum while the region between the cryostat and outer body will contain an inert gas (eg: dry nitrogen will be assumed) regulated to be slightly above atmospheric pressure. The temperature of the N2 gas will be controlled to maintain a stable thermal envelope. The other important role of the inert gas is to prevent degradation of the filter coatings.

A rectangular aperture that moves across the array controls the exposure time for all pixels. Equal exposure time requires the opening edge and the closing edge to have the same motion profile in time. This is achieved by using one long sheet with a central rectangular aperture of constant width. For compact storage, the sheet attaches to and wraps around two rollers to form a scroll. Tthere are two closed positions so the sheet advances in the same direction from closed to open to closed. The sheet reverses direction for the next cycle.  This would be of great benefit if the minimum exposure time were much shorter than currently required. 
<P>
Controlling the exposure time to millisecond precision is equivalent to controlling position of the aperture edges to several tenths of millimeters. Standard feedforward and feedback control techniques  maintain acceptable following error (i.e., the controller component of error) for this well defined motion profile. Placing sensors on the rollers is easy and reliable and the average of the two accounts for the effective roller radius changing as the sheet rolls up on itself. This effect is small for a thin metal sheet. In addition, a metal sheet is opaque, does not outgas, can be processed for high fatigue strength and low wear, and is stable and rigid in plane."

<P>
The filter carousel stores a set of color filters and the changer inserts any one as needed for the particular observational task. Five color filters fit within the camera housing on a carousel that rotates about the camera axis. The carousel presents the appropriate filter to the lower station where the exchange can be made through the space between the shutter rollers. . A wheeled cart (transporter) conveys the filter along the tracks between the carousel and use position.
<P>
The filter substrates differ from one another in their central thickness, ranging from 13.5 to 22 mm. The convex spherical radius is the same for all filters and is placed the same inside the camera"

set DESC(camera) "The camera is one of the three primary LSST technical subsystems (along with the Telescope/Site Subsystem and the
Data Management Subsystem). It contains a 3.2 Gigapixel focal plane array, comprised of roughly 200 4K x 4K CCD
sensors, with 10 micron pixels. 
<P>The sensors are deep depleted, back illuminated devices with a highly segmented
architecture that enables the entire array to be read out in 2 s or less. These detectors are grouped into 3 x 3 arrays called
rafts. Each raft contains its own dedicated front end and back end electronics boards, which fit within the footprint of its
sensors, thus serving as a 144 Megapixel camera on its own. 
<P>All of the rafts, with their associated electronics, are mounted
on a silicon carbide grid inside a vacuum cryostat, with an intricate thermal control system that maintains the CCDs at an
operating temperature of roughly minus 90 degrees centigrade.
<P>The grid also contains sets of guide sensors and wavefront
sensors at the edge of the field. The entire grid, with the sensors, is actuated at a rate ~ 30 Hz in a fast guiding mode to
maintain a very narrow psf (0.7 arcseconds median), which is limited mainly by seeing fluctuations in the overlying
atmosphere.
<P>The entrance window to the cryostat is the third of the three refractive lenses. The other two lenses are mounted in an optics
structure at the front of the camera body. The camera body also contains a mechanical shutter, and a carrousel assembly
that holds five large optical filters, any of which can be inserted into the camera field of view for a given exposure. A sixth
optical filter will also be fabricated which can replace any of the five via an automated procedure accomplished during
daylight hours.
<P>
The camera system consists of multiple subsystems that include utilities, the camera body vessel and mechanisms for
shuttering and optical filtering, the imaging sensors, optical lenses and filters, a computerized data acquisition and control
system, the cryostat holding the detector array, readout and control electronics, wavefront sensors, and guide sensors."

<P>
Arrays of 3×3 sensors are mounted to raft structures that in turn mount to the integrating
structure. Raft structure plates are double side lapped all at once to be flat, parallel and the same size to less than 1 µm. Thus, rafts assembled with sensors are flat, parallel and the same height to 6.5 µm peak to valley. The raft structure and the sensor substrate have a well matched coefficient of thermal expansion and good thermal conduction to maintain this flatness performance during operation, since the assembly is subject to large temperature changes (ambient to operating temperature)."

The 201 CCDs fully populate 21 focal plane rafts with 9 CCDs each and partially populate 4 rafts with 3 CCDs each. A dedicated state machine based controller issues timing and control signals to Camera Electronics. Specifically, it controls all signals required by both Front End Cards and Back End Cards. These include all CCD clocks, Signal Processing ASIC timing/control signals, A to D conversion control signals on the Back End, and so forth. Note that sensor data is normally not returned to the SAC, but is routed out of the camera on multiple Data Fibers. The control module for this subsystem would run on an embedded processor providing an interface between the CCM and the dedicated state machine based controller."
