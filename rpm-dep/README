This directory contains the SAL dependency checker. 

To use it copy this directory to a disk with plenty of space, then cd into it and 

	./grepper.sh

This will download all the github/ts_sal repositories, and a select few from github/lsst-dm, 
plus the CCS SAL jar files from the Nexus 3 server.

It then examines all the code to identify uses of XML based SAL CSC code. 
For each downloaded codebase a file will be created in the ./refs subdirectory with a name 
formed from the codebase name

e.g. for ts_hexapod, the dependencies would be listed in 

	./refs/ts_hexapod.refs

If you have already downloaded a particular codebase you can check only it's dependencies
by using 

	./grepcsc.sh  path-to-codebase
